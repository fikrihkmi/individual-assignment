<br> The image shown above is the picture of me, my mother, Kelthom binti Zakaria, and my father, Mat Yunus bin Mohamed, during my first semester at UiTM Cawangan Kelantan Kampus Machang. Both of them is such a loving and caring parent. The reason that I can further my study to the higher education is because of their support and encouragement that I can strive to become more successful in my life.
